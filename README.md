Overview:
The main motive for making this project is to make a responsive website design using bootstrap but no additional media queries were used. (Not for font sizes too across various screen sizes) 

Feauture:
1. The only feauture i would like to mention is no additional media query were used.
2. Because bootstrap does not have a huge amount of classes like tailwind, so for example bootstrap does not provide any classes for the font sizes to make it responsive across all devuce widths.
3. SO i used clamp() function to make the text size auto adjust itself according to the screensize with the given biundaries provided by me.
